## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a vital task for businesses looking to retain customers. In this repository, we have developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The model is trained on a dataset with various customer attributes and their churn status (whether they churned or not). The goal is to accurately predict which customers are at risk of churning.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in building a machine learning model. In this project, we perform several data preprocessing tasks, including:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical features
Scaling features
Feature selection
The code for data preprocessing can be found in the provided Python script.

Model Training and Evaluation
We train the customer churn prediction model using various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Model training and evaluation are performed using the provided Python script.

Performance Visualization
The performance of the trained model is visualized using various metrics, including accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curves. The code for performance visualization can be found in the provided Python script.

Choosing a Machine Learning Model
You can choose from different machine learning algorithms to train the customer churn prediction model. The provided Python script includes a function to select the model of your choice.
