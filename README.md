## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a vital task for businesses looking to retain customers. In this repository, we have developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The model is trained on a dataset with various customer attributes and their churn status (whether they churned or not). The goal is to accurately predict which customers are at risk of churning.
